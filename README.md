# Blogging Engine
This is a combination of projects that I created as part of Udacity's Web Application Engineering course -- an  introductory 
course to the realm of web development. The projects include a blogging engine and a wiki application. This was my first experience
with developing web apps, and by working my way through the projects, I picked up working knowledge of the following components
of the web:

<ul>
  <li>HTTP</li>
  <li>Web frameworks</li>
  <li>Dynamic content generation</li>
  <li>Caching</li>
  <li>Scaling</li>
  <li>User authentication</li>
  <li>Cookies</li>
  <li>Password hashing</li>
  <li>Databases</li>
  <li>Web APIs</li>
</ul>

The backend was programmed with Python (using the webapp2 framework). The working version of the project can be found <a href="myprojectslib.appspot.com">here</a>.
